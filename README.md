# About Planr React

A simple, lightweight web application for managing a list of field campaigns.

Inspired by PlanFeld, it features an overly-simplified version of the core campaign (aka Session) management activities limited to 
- Listing of recorded campaigns
- Recording of new campaigns
- Editing of existing campaigns.

Planr is implemented as a single-page application (SPA) with the operations around campaign creation, update, and deletion performed via a modal form.
