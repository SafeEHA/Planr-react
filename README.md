# About Planr React

A simple, lightweight web application for managing a list of field campaigns.

Inspired by PlanFeld, it features an overly-simplified version of the core campaign (aka Session) management activities limited to 
(1) listing of recorded campaigns 
(2) recording of new campaigns 
(3) editing of existing campaigns.

Planr is implemented as a single-page application (SPA) with the operations around campaign creation, update and deletion performed via a modal form.
